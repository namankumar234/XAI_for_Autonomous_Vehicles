# XAI_for_Autonomous_Vehicles

This repository contains the implementation of an Explainable AI (XAI) model for autonomous vehicle detection using camera inputs. The project leverages techniques like **Grad-CAM**, **LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation)**, and **Grad-CAM++** to provide visual explanations for the decisions made by the AI model.

## üìå Features
- **Object Detection**: Detect vehicles in real-time using camera feeds.
- **Explainability**: Visualize the decision-making process using XAI techniques:
  - Grad-CAM
  - Grad-CAM++
  - LRP
- **Customizability**: Easily integrate with other AI models and datasets.

## üîß Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Frameworks:
  - **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (Specify based on your implementation)
  - **OpenCV** for image processing
- XAI Libraries:
  - **Captum** (for PyTorch users)
  - **tf-explain** (for TensorFlow users)
- Visualization: **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**

üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namankumar/XAI_for_Autonomous_Vehicles.git
cd XAI_for_Autonomous_Vehicles
```

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python is installed. Then, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run different .py files and .ipynb notebooks according to usage.

üìä Results
Heatmaps: Highlight regions in the image that the model focused on.
Metrics: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP.
